      <h3>BESimplified</h3>
      <h4>01</h4>
      <p>BESimplified, the result of a school project, pushed me to create an app for a specific audience. it was an
        eye-opener in terms of research and problem-solving. i couldn't choose my audience, so i had to adapt everything
        to match their needs. it was a valuable experience that taught me a lot about design and client work. looking
        back, it was a lot of fun, and i learned a great deal.</p>

      <h3>Virtunes</h3>
      <h4>02</h4>
      <p>my most significant project to date is Virtunes, another school project with more creative freedom. we had the
        liberty to choose our target group, which allowed me to spread my wings. it was a challenging experience in
        collaboration as i faced some issues with my teammate, but i remained committed to making it work.</p>
      <p>Virtunes was all about combining my love for music and design. it aimed to be a digital platform for virtual
        concerts, a concept close to my heart. though i couldn't fully realize it, i'm proud of what I achieved.</p>

      <h3>way 2 art</h3>
      <h4>03</h4>
      <p>way 2 art was a project focused on open-air museums, inspired by my visit to the Middelheim Museum in Antwerp.
        it struck me that new visitors could easily get lost and thus not see all the sculptures, so i proposed a
        solution – AR glasses that guide you through the museum. while we didn't need to fully develop it, we had to
        conceptualize how it would function and what it might look like.</p>

      <h3>UGC rebranding</h3>
      <h4>04</h4>
      <p>one of my keen interests lies in platform usability. we were entrusted with the task of improving the UGC app,
        focusing on functionality rather than branding. this project was quite a significant undertaking, but i found it
        incredibly enjoyable. i've always had a deep fascination with films, and when a project aligns with my passions,
        you can count on my full dedication.</p>
