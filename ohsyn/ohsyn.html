    <p class="pagetext">it was definitely time to figure out a branding for myself. this is something we've learned at school, so we also got it as task. i found it very exciting but also quite challeging. there are various styles that can powerfully represent who I am, since I don't see myself the same every day. one day I'd like to be somewhat classy and neat and on other days, it's a whole different story. I also happen to be very interested in different styles, so I just knew that this wouldn't be easy.</p>
    <p class="pagetext">so while I was getting down creating a brand for myself, I started with a classy vibe and chose the name "studio ohsyn". this can be seen on the pictures down here. once it came to putting together my portfolio website, I had a complete change of heart. I was in love with the name, so that stayed. yet the whole branding had to change, since I didn't really like it anymore. and to be fully honest, there were also moments near the end of programming my website that I wanted to change the branding again (the branding that I have now).</p>
    <p class="pagetext">looking back, i'm still pretty happy though. both the initial branding I came up with and the one I've got now. nonetheless, I thought it would be cool to share the first branding concept I had for studio ohsyn.</p>
